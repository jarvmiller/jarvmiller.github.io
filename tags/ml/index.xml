      <description>Back to talk about NN a bit more! We talked about linear and nonlinear decision boundaries last time we left off. This is why multi-layered NNs have at least one nonlinear function applied to the input if not many (even many different nonlinear functions). So how do we even start using a Neural Network? Itâ€™s beneficial to talk about the input before we talk about all the things we do to that input.</description>

      <description>I have an assignment that involves building a language identifier (given text, predict which language is the text from) using Neural Nets. I wanted to use this opportunity to make a few posts to cement the idea into my head. I hope you find this intuitive and helpful.
So lets talk about NN in terms of classification, when I think of neural networks, I think of applying a multi-layered system to make a decision.</description>
