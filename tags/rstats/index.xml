      <description>I recently listened to a podcast that talked about 1960s track titled “Amen, Brother” by The Winstons. It is the most-sampled track ever based on whosampled.com. Here is a link to a particular part of the song, the 6 second drum solo known as the Amen Break that is the reason for the 2800+ samples heard in Hip-Hop, EDM, the Futurama intro, etc. I wanted to see who were the type of artists sampling this song and how did they use the sample.</description>

      <description>I want to become familiar with both the tools in the tidyverse as well as in Python. This blog post will highlight some of the typical things people might do in R or Python when working with data. It’s not meant as a ‘from scratch’ tutorial so there are things I won’t explain thoroughly or at all. It’s mainly so I can remember pandas functionality. For now, we will focus on wrangling the data.</description>
