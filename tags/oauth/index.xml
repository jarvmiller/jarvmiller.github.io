      <description>Note: if you wanna skip straight to the repository, it&amp;rsquo;s here.
This semester I learned about utilizing APIs and Oauth2 to get data from web services. Time to put this into the test and do something cool - build a crappy song recommender. Here are the steps I followed after some brainstorming. Shoutout to Spotify for having nice data about each song.
 Ask for several artists that you vibe to Via Spotify, get a few related artists for each artist that the user input Get all albums for each artist as well as their songs get song features for each song (valence/musical positiveness, tempo, danceability, speechiness, energy) Via Genius&amp;rsquo;s API, search for that song and artist combo for each song and get the song&amp;rsquo;s lyrics calculate the sentiment of those lyrics store it all in two database tables, one for songs and one for artists  Now that I have the data, how should I go about recommending songs?</description>
