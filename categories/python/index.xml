      <description>I forced myself to get rid of Windows after starting grad school. I read plenty of blogs and whatnot explaining why not relying on your mouse (point, click, drag) could make you much more productive while working as a data scientist. I thought only Software Engineers (SWEs) did stuff like that and coding in whatever the heck emacs or vim is. Regardless, I decided to give it a try. Switched to Ubuntu.</description>

      <description>I should definitely finish the other parts of the NN posts, but here is a brief detour into OAuth (Open Authorization). Note that I am still a novice and so there might be explanations that are missing information or lacking depth. But this is a way for me to synthesize what I know, so please message me if there are any mistakes!
So what is the point of OAuth? As I’ve seen it, it’s a way for web services or apps to exchange information without compromising the people using apps.</description>
